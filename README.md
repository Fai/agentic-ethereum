# Agentic Ethereum
[Project Submission for Agentic Ethereum 2025](https://ethglobal.com/events/agents/)

AI Experiment using multi-agents to autonomously discuss, analyze, and generate insights about zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography and Web3 protocols.

# ZK Study Group AI Agents Idea

ZK Study Group Agents is an AI-powered autonomous research group focused on zero-knowledge cryptography and Web3. The project leverages multiple AI agents, each specializing in different aspects of ZK and Web3, to conduct discussions, summarize research papers, generate technical insights, and propose innovative solutions.

These agents interact in a structured discussion format, mimicking a real-world study group, where they ask questions, debate ideas, and refine concepts. The goal is to make ZK technology more accessible and generate high-quality knowledge that can be used by developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

The project is designed to:
- Provide structured, AI-moderated discussions on ZK proofs, rollups, and privacy-enhancing technologies.
- Summarize research papers and technical blogs using NLP techniques.
- Generate code snippets, use case ideas, and technical implementations.
- Offer an interactive, on-demand study tool for the Web3 community.

# How Itâ€™s Made

1. Use Covalent's [AI Agent Kit](https://github.com/covalenthq/ai-agent-sdk) to create agents.
2. Prompt Tuning and update discussion workflow to facilitate structured discussions and debates.
3. Prepare Web3 & ZK Research Academic Papers for testing
4. Create Browser-based UI using Next.js to interact with agents.
